//AddGun shortName amountOf item
//AddAmmo must come immediately after AddGun for them to be in the same slot
//The names of the items / blocks are those in the code, with some exceptions such as iron (ingotIron) and gunpowder (sulphur)
//And with parts from this mod, they are the shortName of the item
//Guns cannot yet have multiple ammo types in the same slot. For now, just list them under two seperate guns that are the same
//NumGuns must come before all the addGun lines and must be correct.
